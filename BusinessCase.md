**Business Case**
The AIDAP (AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform) is a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance the digital experience for students, faculty, and administrators at educational institutions. This platform provides a conversational interface for users to interact with institutional data such as course schedules, academic deadlines, announcements, and performance analytics. AIDAP utilizes advanced AI models to deliver personalized, contextual answers to queries, streamlining academic and administrative processes.

The primary goal of AIDAP is to improve student engagement, support faculty in managing course-related tasks, and increase administrative efficiency. Students will benefit from real-time access to academic resources, automated notifications, and a personalized dashboard summarizing key performance metrics. Faculty will have access to class analytics, automated reminders, and a centralized hub for managing course materials. Administrators will be able to disseminate campus-wide announcements, monitor system usage, and manage integrations with existing university systems seamlessly.

AIDAP will be deployed as a cloud-native solution, offering high availability and scalability to support up to 5,000 concurrent users. The system aims for 99.5% uptime and a response time of under 2 seconds under normal operating conditions. With its ability to integrate with existing systems like the Learning Management System (LMS), registration, and calendar platforms, AIDAP is poised to streamline workflows, improve data access, and provide a more cohesive digital experience for the entire academic community.

The institution currently lacks an integrated platform for students, faculty, and administrators to access real-time academic and administrative information. Students struggle with tracking deadlines and performance, while faculty face challenges in managing course materials and communicating updates. Administrators have limited tools for disseminating announcements and monitoring data. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, slow response times, and missed opportunities for engagement. A unified, AI-powered platform is needed to streamline workflows and improve communication across all stakeholders.

The proposed solution is to deploy the AIDAP system, an AI-powered digital assistant platform that integrates with existing university systems (LMS, registration, calendar) to provide:
- Personalized Dashboards for students that summarize schedules, deadlines, grades, and performance metrics.
- Automated Notifications to keep students updated about class schedules, assignments, and campus-wide announcements.
- AI-powered Query Handling for faculty and students to interact with the system in a conversational manner to access academic data and insights.
- Administrative Tools for efficient management of course materials, announcements, and real-time system monitoring.

AIDAP will be deployed as a cloud-native, scalable solution ensuring high availability (99.5% uptime) and quick response times (under 2 seconds).

Project Scope
- The initial deployment will focus on providing AI-powered digital assistance for students, faculty, and administrators, with a target of supporting up to 5,000 concurrent users.
- 100 time servers (for scalability) will be used initially, with plans to expand further.
- A cloud-native infrastructure will be adopted for high availability, performance, and ease of scaling.
- Future expansions will include more advanced AI models, multi-language support, and integration with additional third-party tools.
