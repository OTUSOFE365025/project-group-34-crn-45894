The AIDAP is a tool created to improve the digital experience for administrators, teachers, and students in educational institutions. Users can interact with institutional data, like announcements, academic deadlines, course schedules, and performance analytics, through the system's conversational interface. AIDAP simplifies procedures by using sophisticated AI models to provide personalized responses to queries.

AIDAP's objective is to improve the institution's efficiency, assist teachers in managing course-related tasks, and raise student involvement. A personalized dashboard with automated notifications,performance indicators, and access to learning resources will all be available to students. Instructors will benefit from an integrated platform for managing course content, automated reminders, and class analytics. Managing links with current university systems, monitoring system usage, and sending campus notifications will be easy for administrators.

During normal use, the system aims for 99.5% availability and a response time of less than two seconds. AIDAP can expand access to information, automate processes, and give the entire academic community a more unified digital experience by integrating with the other systems used by the institution like the LMS, registration, and calendar systems.

Currently the institution does not have an integrated platform where administrators, instructors, and students can examine academic and administrative data in real time. While teachers find it difficult to keep an eye on course material and provide updates, students also find it difficult to keep track of deadlines and performance. Administrators lack the resources to monitor information and make announcements. Inefficiencies, slow reaction times, and wasted engagement opportunities happen because of this division. To streamline procedures and improve communication across all stakeholders, an integrated platform driven by AI is required.

The solution is to implement the AIDAP system, an AI digital assistant program that can be connected with the current university systems (calendar, registration, and LMS) to provide:
-  Personalized Student dashboards which gather data on performance, grades, deadlines, and schedules.
-  Students can receive automated notifications about campus-wide announcements, assignments, and class schedules.
-  Students and staff can ask the system questions in a conversational way to get academic data and information using AI-based query handling.
- Administrators have the ability to efficiently manage announcements, course content, and real-time system monitoring.

AIDAP will be deployed as a cloud-native, scalable application with high availability (99.5% uptime) and fast response times (under 2 seconds).

Project Scope
- The initial deployment will be focused on digital AI assistance to students, teachers, and administrators with a target of allowing 2,000 users simultaneously accessing the system.
- 100 time servers (as a starting point) will be used, but can be scaled up later.
- A cloud infrastructure will be used in support of high availability, performance, and scalability.
- Future expansions will include better AI models, multi-language support, and integration with additional third-party tools.
