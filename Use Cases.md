|UC 4: Maintain System    | System maintainers deploy updates with zero downtime and also perform secure backup and restoration of data          |
|UC 5: System Access| Students, Lecturers, Administrators, and Maintainers log into AIDAP using the Single Sign-On (SSO). Once authenticated, each user has access to features based on their role.        |
|UC 6: Synchronize Data    | The system automatically synchronizes academic and administrative data between AIDAP and connected university systems like the LMS, registration, and calendar platforms.
